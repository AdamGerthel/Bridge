Bridge
======

Bridge is a small web-based markdown application using [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/). Data is stored locally in the browser and utilizes live synchronization remotely using CouchDB (optional). The app works both offline and online.

### Background

Bridge has been built as an experiment in order to learn more about offline applications and writing experiences in-browser. It is however fully functional, so feel free to fork and improve!

### Installation

You'll need a web server in order to run the application. It's been built using Apache, but Node or similar will work just as well.

1. Clone repo

3. Install Bower dependencies
